producer, but for some this endorsement can be the flash point of a whole career. \n\nUK producer Nu Elementz was still cutting his teeth in the studio when he signed to Majistrate’s Sweet Tooth label, with leading artists like Roni Size and DJ Hype getting behind his tracks from the off.\n\nAs well as Sweet Tooth his high-powered music has also appeared on landmark imprints Playaz and V, while behind the decks he’s also played at the majority of the key parties pushing the lively end of the drum & bass spectrum. \n\nWhen we asked Nu Elementz to record a mix ahead of his performance at our FABRICLIVE Carnival Warm-Up Special next Friday, he got back to us with a selection of characteristically up-front cuts stripping the D&B sound to its rawest form.\n\nNu Elementz plays RM2 on

This one had to be special… \n\nLast spotted on the fourth instalment of the UKF Music Podcast (as it was known back then), the one and only Flux Pavilion returns to our controls and he’s gone well and truly IN. An hour of pure bass abandonment comprising over 70 tracks ranging from house to drum & bass and all shades of gully in between, this is the sound of the Circus ringleader in his element, at his wildest. Drawing records from as far as Bungle to FuntCase, Caspa to Noisia, he’s captured and celebrated everything we love and support across the UKF network. \n\nWe’ve come a long way since our first podcast in May 2010. Huge shout to every DJ who’s taken the controls over the years, huge shout to Flux for this triumphant centennial mix, huge shout to YOU for supporting us. Like always, the tracklist is available on UKF.com.\n\nHere’s to the next 100.\n\nFlux Pavilion\nLike → http://bit.ly/FluxPFacebook\nFollow → http://bit.ly/FluxPTwitter\nListen → http://bit.ly/FluxPSoundCloud\nInstagram → http://bit.ly/FluxPInstagram\n\nArtwork by Doctor P.","label_name":null,"release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/337305893","user":{"id":415653,"kind":"user","permalink":"ukf","username":"UKF","last_modified":"2020/07/16 16:35:43 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/415653","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/ukf","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-pOdV1RLbX3nJsDso-z4bVZA-large.jpg"},"permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/ukf/ukf-podcast-100-flux-pavilion","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000237738505-7jnj2u-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/7kq3M7OVaWXA_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/337305893/stream","playback_count":0,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":8515,"comment_count":178},{"kind":"track","id":207296322,"created_at":"2015/05/26 14:31:14 +0000","user_id":4452531,"duration":7095287,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":283790162,"last_modified":"2020/06/23 17:49:46 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"\"BBC Radio 1\" EssentialMix \"Pete Tong\" Claptone House Deephouse Exploited \"Different Recordings\" Beatport JAW DearLife Ep Single Podcast Mix Radio","permalink":"claptone-bbc-radio-1-essential-mix","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":true,"purchase_url":"http://btprt.dj/1KciMK3","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"BUY NEW CLAPTONE EP","genre":"Electronic","title":"BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix","description":"\nClaptone -

I was pissed since we all want the same – dance to 175 Beats per Minute. Drum & Bass, One Love, you know? So, I picked some local (more or less) MCs and Rappers and sat down to record a mix to reunite the different subgenres once again. 60 minutes of Drum & Bass in which every Subgenre finds its Place – Starting with Jungle and Ragga, then Deep and Minimal, Jump Up, Neuro and Liquid as a finisher. The whole Mix is accompanied by 7 MCs, who – alone or as duo – take on a part of the Drum & Bass Scene and reinterpret it for themselves. Guys – less hate, more love in the scene. Peace, sincerely Minzkönig!\n\nMCs:\n\nStephen Keise is a German Rapper/Singer/Songwriter/Composer and Producer well known for his urban Reggae/Hip-Hop style. Collaborations with artists like Jahcoustix, Dr. Ring Ding and Colah Colah (Jamaica) are included in his catalogue.\n\nKonsul is a German artist in London who’s currently working solo and as part of “Jerome and the Sloth”. From Hip-Hop Beats to Indie Sounds, there is a lot of creative energy on the streets of the British capital. More Drum & Bass projects are bound to follow in the future.\n\nDopZen is a DJ- and Freestyle-veteran and has been around the stages of the world with a variety of bands and soundsystems. His style is somewhere between Reggae, Hip-Hop and Punk-Rock and he has always been a Breakbeat-Fetishist, who you’ll find on the Mic at Drum & Bass Parties.\n\nRatzo MC is one of the Alter Egos of the All-round musician “Eric Greulich”. As Ratzo MC he hosted Drum & Bass parties for over 17 years by now. Also together with his WTK Crew. 2018 he released his first solo album which more like a UK Grime Rap record.\n\nENactiv & Grazy (recently Robstar). Warmly DnB Mcing from Hesse for a very long time now. These dudes of the “Whatever – Finest DnB” crew are doing their thing for way over 10 years, putting substantial lyrics and a good balance between MCing and room for the music. As these Hesses are, they do rap German.\n\nMC Busta, a household name in his home town Birmingham Uk with residencies at Birmingham Playaz, RAM, Hospitality, Raveology plus many more.
